1. State management is your real enemy

Orders have multiple states: Draft → Sent → Preparing → Paid → Completed
If this isn’t centralized, your UI will desync fast.

2. Session logic must be strict

No order without an open session

No payment after session close

Reports must be session-aware, not just date-based

3. Kitchen Display ≠ POS View

Kitchen should never see prices or payment info

Only quantities, products, and stages

4. UPI QR flow must feel real

Even if mocked, the transition from QR → Confirmed → Paid must update:

Order

Customer display

5. Reports

Reporting is where judges look hardest

Anyone can build CRUD

Few build filtered, dynamic analytics
